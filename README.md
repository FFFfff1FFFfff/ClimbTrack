# ClimbTrack: Indoor Climbing Training Logger
## Project Scope

ClimbTrack is a web-based training log tool for indoor climbers. It helps users record their climbing sessions, upload media, write movement notes, detect crowd and track progress over time in an organized, intuitive format.

- Upload and review videos/photos  
- Note down beta, crux moves, or style observations  
- Track personal goals and progress visually  

## Features

### Core Features:
- Log climb sessions (date, location, grade/difficulty)  
- Add movement notes (beta, style, crux descriptions)  
- Upload and store media files (photos and videos)
- Detect the number of people in the climbing gym (number and activities)

## Project Progress
